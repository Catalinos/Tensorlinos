## :pencil: Description
:construction: This is a work in progress :construction:

This is my custom machine learning shared library in C languuage

## :rocket: Getting Started

### :gear: Dependencies

You just need make, gcc and a linux

### :chart_with_upwards_trend: Progress so far
- Created a shared library called _linreg_
- Ability to initialize a custom liniar regression model
- Ability to load a dataset that is read from a file inside the _'artificial_data'_ directory
- FeedForward process
- Few loss functions like MeanSquaredError and MeanAbsoluteError

### :hammer_and_wrench: To do next
- Add more loss functions
- Implement activation functions
- Implement BackPropagation proceess
- Create a full training ability

### :computer: Executing program

In order for the program to run, just execute

``` make all run ```
